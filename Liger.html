  <p class="p">LIGER is the story of a born fighter. Liger (Vijay Deverakonda) shifts to Mumbai with his mother Balamani (Ramya Krishnan) from Banaras and both start running a tea stall. However, their real intent in shifting to the city is to meet Christopher (Ronit Roy). He runs a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) training centre. Balamani requests Christopher to train Liger, that too for free. Christopher rejects the demand at first. But Balamani reminds him that Liger is the son of Lion Balram, a famous fighter who had defeated Christopher in 2004 and who later died. She also insists that since she is unable to afford his fees, Christopher can hire Liger as his servant. Christopher agrees but under two conditions – firstly, Liger should not lose focus, and secondly, he should not run behind women. Liger agrees. Christopher soon realizes that Liger is an expert fighter and can fulfil his father’s wish of winning the national championship. However, Liger bumps into Taniya (Ananya Panday) and both begin a romantic relationship. Liger has a heavy stammer and he fears that Taniya might not be aware of it. Hence, once, when they are partying in a pub, Liger confesses to her. But Taniya, in an inebriated state, tells Liger that she doesn’t mind his stammering. Meanwhile, Taniya and Balamani one day get into a fight. Balamani gets the shock of her life when she realizes that Liger is in love with the girl whom she hates the most. Even Christopher admonishes him. Liger is so crazy in love that he doesn’t pay heed. When Taniya tells him to elope, to which, Liger readily agrees. He breaks into her house and runs with her. Taniya’s brother and fellow MMA championship aspirant Sanju (Vishu Reddy) chases them and confronts Liger. Sanju expresses shock that Taniya fell for a man who can’t even speak fluently. This is when Taniya realizes that Liger stammers. Though Liger had told her the truth, she was so sloshed that she didn’t remember. Hence, she dumps him. What happens next forms the rest of the film.
